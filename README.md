# Pitch Movement Synergy
 Project for the University of Maryland Baseball Team. The goal of this project is to help the team asses pitcher's pitch movement synergy or how similar two pitches horizontal and vertical movement patterns are. This is a simplified version of tunneling that does not include factors like release point, velocity, angle, etc.  
This project is based off the research of Eli Ben-Porat. [Article](https://elibenporat.substack.com/p/pitch-movement-synergy)  
Final output graph is output.png and all code is contained in Pitch_Movement_Synergy.ipynb.
